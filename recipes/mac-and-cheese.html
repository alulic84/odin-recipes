  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>This is a quick and healthy whole plant version of a mac and cheese.

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>

      <li>2 tablespoons nutritional yeast</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon white wine vinegar</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon sea salt</li>

      <li>Fresh basil leaves</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
      <li>Peel squash; halve squash and remove seeds. Cut squash into large pieces. Place squash pieces in a steamer basket in a large pan.
        Add water to saucepan to just below basket. Bring to boiling. Steam, covered, about 12 minutes or until tender.</li>
      <li>Heat a large saucepan over medium. Add onion, garlic, thyme, and ¼ cup water to pan.
        Cook about 10 minutes or until onion is tender, stirring occasionally and adding water,
        1 to 2 Tbsp. at a time, as needed to prevent sticking.</li>
      <li>Transfer onion mixture to a blender. Add squash and the next five ingredients (through pepper).
        Cover and blend until smooth. Pour squash mixture into a large saucepan.</li>
      <li>Cook pasta according to package directions, adding broccoli the last 5 minutes of cooking; drain.
        Add drained pasta and broccoli to squash mixture; toss to coat. Serve warm topped with fresh basil.</li>
